# Route-finding-using-beam-search-algorithm
A visual implementation of the Beam Search algorithm using Python and Pygame. The program allows users to select start and goal nodes on a graph and visualizes the route-finding process step by step. It highlights explored nodes, displays heuristic values, and shows the final optimal path between two points.
